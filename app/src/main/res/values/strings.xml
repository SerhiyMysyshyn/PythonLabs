        <item>We have grown to accept the fact that all individuals, all the time, are constantly expressing radiance, an aura, which is completely unique to our own personalities. But it is not only our own perceptions, which indicate that an aura field exists. There are countless descriptions of these phenomena from clairvoyants, people who are capable of perceiving or actually seeing the human energy field. Some of these sensitive and gifted individuals have proven again and again that they indeed have the ability to perceive a higher dimension of existence.</item>
        <item> </item>
        <item>Many scientists from all around the world have also researched these phenomena. Throughout history, many different names and descriptions have been given to the human life energy field around us. Depending on their cultural background, various scientists and other individuals have referred to this energy field as: Biofield, electro-magnetic field, life force, chi, ki, vital energy or as most people call it, the Aura.</item>

        <item>There can be more than one chakra dominant, which means you perceive life with these qualities. The higher a bar the more dominate you will feel its qualities. Read below about the chakra meanings:</item>
        <item> </item>
        <item>1. Chakra: Root Chakra (in Sanskrit: Muladhara) cappp </item>

This chakra is located at the end of the spine and corresponds to life energy, physical activity, emotional strength, will power and sexuality. Related body areas and organs are joints, muscles, heart, blood and nervous system.</item>
        <item>A high bar means radiant, sensual and passionate qualities; a medium bar shows a healthy lifestyle; a low bar indicates a difficulty to progress in life.</item>
        <item> </item>
        <item>2. Chakra: Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana) cappp </item>

The topics of the 3rd Chakra are personality, self-confidence, will, power, action, control and intellect. </item>
        <item>A high bar indicates creativity, intellectual and analytical thinking with playful qualities. A medium bar shows normal creativity qualities and a low bar shows a low creative input. Try to have more fun and joy in your life to increase your creativity. </item>
        <item> </item>
        <item>4. Chakra: Heart Chakra (Anahata) cappp </item>
        <item>The Heart Chakra is located around the heart area and processes the experiences of love and fine feelings and the emotions that are associated with it. These emotions include love, compassion, devotion, grief, pain and gratitude. It relates to the balance between Body, Mind and Spirit. </item>
        <item>A high bar indicates a strong emotional connection and great communicate skills. An average height indicates loving and sensitive qualities. A low bar shows low expressive qualities. Try to open your heart to connect to your deepest feelings. </item>
        <item> </item>
        <item>5. Chakra: Throat Chakra (Vissudha) cappp </item>
        <item>This chakra is located around the throat and relates to communication, speech, social abilities, verbal and emotional expression. </item>
        <item>If this bar is high up it means you are a true artist and share easily your emotions with others. An average height of the bar here indicates good creativity and a compassionate person. Unbalanced energy shown through a low bar can mean limited emotional and verbal expression at the moment. Maybe you feel sick or something disturbed your feelings towards others. Look inside for answers and find new ways to express your thoughts and emotions. </item>
        <item> </item>
        <item>6. Chakra: 3rd Eye Chakra (Ajna) cappp </item>

It is also the seat of consciousness, the higher mind and inner vision. The related body areas are the eyes, the nervous system, brain and forehead. </item>
        <item>A high bar here indicates high intuitive energy, strong artistic and intuitive qualities. A medium bar still shows over-average intuitive energy with artistic qualities.  A lower bar shows a low level of intuitive and artistic qualities.</item>
        <item>Are you stressed? Time to meditate or simply relax more to find the time to look inside to connect to your intuitive side and creativity.</item>
        <item> </item>
        <item>7. Chakra: Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) cappp </item>
        <item>The Crown Chakra is open upwards; it connects us with the divine. This chakra is located on top of the head and corresponds to intuition, spirituality and enlightenment. Related body areas and organs are brain, nervous system and the top of the head. </item>
        <item>A strong bar shows intuitive energy, high radiance, sensitivity and strong spiritual qualities. You might feel the high energies running through your spine! A medium bar shows good intuitive energy, you are very sensitive and have high-developed spiritual qualities. Sometimes this energy can be so high you feel lost or scattered. If this is the case you need to recharge all your other chakras immediately by connecting to all through visualization or similar techniques.</item>
        <item>A low bar shows that the need for spirituality is not very high yet. To strengthen this chakra you can learn meditation or simply being in the moment. Low bar here might also say that you have a different perspective in life and need to put your focus on more current needs. Often white energy shows transformation and change, you might be in the middle finding a new direction in your life</item>

        <item>shows your actual skin temperature; typical is a value between 25–32. Strong wave lines show that you are highly emotional stressed, agitated, very excitement and probably pretty nervousness. A smooth wave lines show you are centered, stable, passive and keep emotions inside.</item>
        <item>    </item>
        <item>The PULSE GRAPH cappp </item>
        <item>displays your actual PULSE. STRESSED lines mean tense, stressed condition will register as many up and down lines. RELAXED lines mean you are in a relaxed harmonious state, the line will be smooth and be fairly straight.</item>
        <item>    </item>
        <item>The BLOOD OXYGEN SATURATION GRAPH cappp</item>
        <item formatted="false">can be a sensitive and responsive marker to acute stress. This diagram shows the heartbeats recorded like its done with an electrocardiogram (ECG). Note that variation in the time interval between consecutive heartbeats, giving a different heart rate (in beats per minute) for each inter-beat interval. An increase in your base value indicates a decrease of your stress response and an increase in your body-mind relaxation.</item>
        <item formatted="false">A steady waveform indicates daily physical activity or normal relaxation level reached, the &#x0025; rate should be close to 100&#x0025;.</item>
        <item>    </item>
        <item>The HRV GRAPHS cappp</item>
        <item>displays your HEART RATE VOLTAGE and reflects the coherence or connection between body, mind and heart.</item>
        <item>The HRV is a measure of the patterns embedded in the heartbeat and a reflection of the autonomic nervous system. The nervous system, heart rate, blood pressure regulation and respiration are under control of autonomic nervous system. HRV is an excellent indicator of many health parameters. If the lines are very stressed your Body-Mind-Heart Connection is strong. If the line doesn’t move much means you have a normal connection. A value up to 1.5 hz shows a normal range, anything higher should be closer monitored at a doctors office.</item>
        <item>    </item>
        <item>The Heart Rhythm cappp</item>
        <item>The normal variability in heart rate is due to the synergistic action of the two branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the part of the nervous system that regulates most of the body’s internal functions. The sympathetic nerves act to accelerate heart rate, while the parasympathetic (vagus) nerves slow it down. The sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS are continually interacting to maintain cardiovascular activity in its optimal range and to permit appropriate reactions to changing external and internal conditions. The analysis of HRV therefore serves as a dynamic window into the function and balance of the autonomic nervous system.</item>
        <item>    </item>
        <item>The moment-to-moment variations in heart rate are generally overlooked when average heart rate is measured (for example, when your doctor takes your pulse over a certain period of time and calculates that your heart is beating at, say, 70 beats per minute). However, the AuraFit technologies allow you to observe your heart’s changing rhythms in real time. Using your pulse data, your HRV Coherence and the HRV-Voltage it provides a picture of your HRV - plotting the natural increases and decreases in your heart rate occurring on a continual base. Emotional stress, including emotions such as anger, frustration, and anxiety gives rise to heart rhythm patterns that appear irregular and erratic: the HRV waveform looks like a series of uneven, jagged peaks. Scientists call this an incoherent heart rhythm pattern.</item>
        <item>    </item>
        <item>Positive emotions send a strong signal throughout our body. When we experience uplifting emotions such as appreciation, joy, care, and love; our heart rhythm pattern becomes highly ordered, looking like a smooth, harmonious wave.</item>

        <item>YELLOWS have a problem with punctuality; they hate responsibility or commitment and easily start many projects with difficulty completing them. Dark and muddy yellow indicates a nervous temperament with unclear thinking. You might just feel stressed or even suffer from a headache already. This color can show up in the aura field when we overwork or don’t have enough sleep or just feel exhausted. If you read the yellow qualities and feel they don’t fit you please come back when you feel relax and healthy and take another aura reading. If its still yellow you are a true yellow!</item>
        <item> </item>
        <item>To much yellow energy over a longer time can lead to over exhaustion, loneliness, egoism, power mania or obsession with career.</item>
        <item>Out-of-power Yellows will be drawn toward negative dependencies such as drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, candies, overeating or unrealistic philosophies. At first they will feel good, even light, with a sense of release. However, soon depression, lethargy, apathetic and confused feelings and thoughts will surface. You need to change their focus from negative addictions toward positive and healthy activities.</item>

        <item>The first step towards any healing is to understand where the emotional cause behind any physical pain comes from. Ask yourself when did the physical pain start? Meditate on the issue what the emotional reason could be? Was it something your partner, friend, college, boss… said? We often have emotional response to something that happens quickly and we try to forget or push it away. This is not healthy; we need to reflect about and express the feelings connected to this issue. If you don’t express that feeling it gets stuck in your emotional aura and moves eventual into the physical sphere to create sickness and pain. Release is the answer to heal.</item>

        <item>Depending on your personal and spiritual beliefs, a white aura can hold far greater meaning.
